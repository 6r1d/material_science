# Material science mod

This mod adds new materials and blocks into Minetest. It's in pre-alpha stage currently.

For now, there's a screenshot of a decomposer block, which decomposes stone dust to the minerals.
The idea is to give user different types of materials (often in raw, oxidized state, requiring further processing).

![](doc/images/screenshot_a.png)

Currently, it can output these types of dusts: silicon, aluminium, iron, calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, carbon, sulfur, chromium, zinc, copper, lead, tin, silver, gold. These elements are sorted by distribution in Earth's crust, your chance to get gold is far lower than your chance to get silicon.

I'll soon add Technic mod's HV power input.

Any advices about blocks using new elements (or old, too) are welcome. For instance, I want to add phosphorus with its temporary glow and phosphorus-doped glass with the same properties.
